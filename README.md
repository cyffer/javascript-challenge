JavaScript Assignment

**TABLE AND DATE SEARCH**
Created a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

Used the provided UFO dataset and incorporated the form with a Javascript functionality to search array in JS objects. The code appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

The page contains a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
Applied a date form in the HTML document and wrote JS code that is activated on mouse events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

**Level 2: Multiple Search Categories**

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

`date/time`

`city`

`state`

`country`

`shape`
